# Sorting-Algorithms
Project 1 for my class “CS331 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms” where different sorting algorithms were implemented and for each sort algorithm, there was multiple conditions where each condition had arrays of sizes 2^1 – 2^16 elements to sort. Each one of these had the time taken.
